      <div class="wel-cont">
        Nature has always been a great inspiration to artists - from cave
        drawings of animals, to contemporary artists working today. Artists have
        depicted nature as a setting to express their inner feelings, forever

        stated,

      <div class="wel-quote">
        “Painting from nature is not copying the object; it is realizing one’s
        sensations. Treat nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone,
        everything in proper perspective.”

          In Japan, straw played a large role in everyday life not only as an
          agricultural feedstuff but also as the raw materials of Japanese style
          straw shoes, straw coats, blankets, food wrappers, carrier bags and
          all that. However, it was until a hundred years before present.
